In this assignment, I applied Bigram Language Model for 100 articles in Bahasa Indonesia with keyword “korupsi”. The model is evaluated by using perplexity from a sample test, then the result is analyzed. For the sample test, I'm using a sentence that related to "Korupsi" and another sentence that unrelated to "Korupsi". I got the result that with sentence that related to "Korupsi", the perplexity is lower than sentence that unrelated to "Korupsi".
